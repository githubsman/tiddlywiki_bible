<pre>* The collection of Proverbs is designed to instruct future kings  --  and so we are.
* As the Psalms are provided to shape our emotions, so the Proverbs shape our communications and much of our relational conduct.
* In many ways the book closely resembles Egyptian writings known as [Sbyoet ?]  (unlike these, it has no addressee, because it is for the entire covenant community).  This may be attributed to Solomon's attempts to emulate Egypt's government.  According to Bruce Waltke, his brightest minds were trained there.  (For more of Waltke's insights, see Revelation and Understanding.)
* Treat a proverb as a parable from the lips of our Lord.  Ask Him for the explanation.
* Chapters 1-9 of Proverbs seem to be a cohesive unit.
* Solomon's early prayer was the perfect exemplar of chapter 2, and chapter 2 is the perfect fulfillment of his prayer.

<pre>Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel: {{rf{2}}} To know wisdom and instruction, to understand sayings of understanding, {{rf{3}}} to gain insightful instruction, righteousness and justice and equity, {{rf{4}}} to give shrewdness to the simple, knowledge and purpose to the young, {{rf{5}}} may the wise hear and increase learning, and the one who understands gain direction, {{rf{6}}} to understand a proverb and an expression, words of wisdom and their riddles. {{rf{7}}} Fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; wisdom and instruction, fools despise. {{rf{8}}} My child, may you keep your father's instruction, and do not reject your mother's teachings, {{rf{9}}} for they are a garland of favor for your head, and pendants for your neck. {{rf{10}}} My child, if sinners entice you, do not consent. {{rf{11}}} If they say, &quot;Come with us! We shall lie in wait for blood; we shall ambush the innocent without cause. {{rf{12}}} Like Sheol, we will swallow them alive and whole, like those who descend to the pit. {{rf{13}}} We shall find all precious wealth, we shall fill our houses with booty, {{rf{14}}} you shall throw your lot in our midst, there will be one purse for all of us.&quot; {{rf{15}}} My child, do not walk in their way. Keep your foot from their paths, {{rf{16}}} for their feet run to evil, and they hurry to shed blood, {{rf{17}}} for &quot;in vain is the net scattered, in the sight of any winged bird.&quot; {{rf{18}}} They lie in wait for their own blood. They ambush their own lives. {{rf{19}}} Thus are the ways of all who are greedy for gain -- it will take the life of its possessors. {{rf{20}}} Wisdom calls out in the streets, in the squares she raises her voice. {{rf{21}}} On a busy corner she cries out, at the entrances of the gates in the city, she speaks her sayings: {{rf{22}}} &quot;How long, O simple ones, will you love simplicity? And how long will scoffers delight in their scoffing, and fools hate knowledge? {{rf{23}}} May you turn to my argument! Behold, I shall pour out my spirit upon you; I will make my words known to you. {{floatright tiny{ [[Open|Proverbs-01-01]] }}}</pre>

<pre>&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:2 abbr&gt;&gt; //know//   --  Waltke prefers &quot;attain&quot;, so as to avoid the materialistic error.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:03 abbr &gt;&gt; 	//Dealings//, relationships, interactions. Control is a big theme to follow.
1:6 riddles   --  wisdom has a way of concealing itself from the arrogant.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:7 abbr &gt;&gt;, Colossians (in whom are all... Wisdom n knowledge... That no one may... Fine sounding arguments), Timothy (guard what was entrusted to you... Opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge... Rather than on Christ). 1peter, always ready to give a defense - but before that: setting apart Christ as Lord. Hi Most apologetics today puts the creature in the place of the judge, weighing the evidence. &quot;Every building has a builder&quot; is not a worthy application of Hebrews, for God is not *a* builder and Hebrews does not present Him in that way.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:09 abbr &gt;&gt; 	You are made attractive. As was Jesus in Capernaum.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:10 abbr &gt;&gt; 	Words can make you attractive; so sinners entice with adornments of their own. You are not to be attracted.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:10 abbr &gt;&gt;. The first specific instruction is to have a boundary.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:11 abbr &gt;&gt;-14 enticements presented in reverse order. ??
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:14 abbr &gt;&gt; 	A little snare all its own. The bad guys have their own shootout near the end.  The safety of their secrecy is only imagined.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:17 abbr &gt;&gt; 	You can see the snare. The snare is them.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:17 abbr &gt;&gt;-18. The bird perfectly sees the snare made by the hunter. (It will succeed on a different bird.) You are to be that bird. You can walk out as Jesus did in Capernaum. The evildoer perfectly fails to see the snare made by himself. Acharit.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 1:22 abbr &gt;&gt;-23 	Reciprocal. Wisdom is prominent and available, yet flouted and neglected. Her loneliness is the loneliness of Jesus. 
1:23    see Jol 2:28
1:32-33 see 8:35-36, &lt;&lt;Bbl J 3:36 &gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 2:1 abbr&gt;&gt;-6  He takes his own words as inspired of God. See &lt;&lt;Bbl Ps 9:10 &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 2:4 abbr &gt;&gt;-5	Look for wisdom, get God.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 2:4 abbr &gt;&gt;	Indeed wisdom __is__ hidden treasure, &lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 25:2 &gt;&gt;.

&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 3:5 abbr &gt;&gt; condemns the evidence approach. If one was convinced God is to be worshipped and later convinced contrary, they never submitted to God's instruction. But we go to work trying to repair their perceptions - the Bible really says this about the topic, etc. If we succeed, nothing fundamental is gained. A conversion from purported atheism to purported deism is worthless.  &lt;&lt;Bbl 2Tim 2:25 &gt;&gt; says first repentance, then the knowledge of the truth.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 3:17 abbr &gt;&gt;	Interesting liberty to take, to speak of a //tree of life//.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 3:31 abbr &gt;&gt; Use that ungodly man as a negative model.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 3:35 abbr&gt;&gt;	Folly comes with instant gratification.

&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 4:21 abbr&gt;&gt;, 25-26  Like a HUD (heads-up display).

&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 5:6 abbr &gt;&gt;a	Be not curious.</pre>

<pre>&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 10:19 abbr &gt;&gt;   The fallen nature.

&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 11:14 abbr&gt;&gt;   The Bible is a multitude of counselors.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 11:30 abbr&gt;&gt;   We usually read this backward (as do the Open Bible and other evangelism teachings ): in order to be wise, we should go out and &quot;win souls.&quot;

&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 12:25 abbr &gt;&gt; 	Part A, isolation. Part B, intervention.

&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 13:22 abbr&gt;&gt;   see &lt;&lt;Bbl Josh 24:13 &gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 14:4 abbr &gt;&gt; Life's a trade-off.  Investment has a return.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 14:30 abbr &gt;&gt;  The life of the body is a heart at peace, but envy rots the bones.

15:14   The uses of singular, plural inform us that fools are more common than wise men.

16:26   [[Future]]-orientation.
&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 16:26 abbr &gt;&gt;    Possibly illustrated by Eddie Acaro's warning about silk pajamas.

17:3    God always reveals the most basic motivations within us.  In the furnace the weightiest element goes to the very bottom and there becomes pure.  Hell is pure, and heaven is pure.  God is the weightiest element in the life of the godly man.  Thus circumstances, heat, and pressure tend to reveal God in his life.

&lt;&lt;Bbl Pr 18:8 abbr &gt;&gt;    //The words of a whisperer// -- Like the Inuit method of hunting a polar bear.  They create an everlasting gob-stopper of death.  //They wind it and they bind it, to bring down the polar bear.//  They don't coat the device with second-rate lard.  They use choice whale blubber.  Gossip is &quot;decadently delicious&quot;, as the purveyors of chocolate say (in an oblique acknowledgment of &quot;decay&quot;).  

As with so many proverbs, this is not written for the benefit of the whisperer, but for the benefit of the whisperer's companion.

19:23   This verse describes Ruth's life.
19:27   This verse describes Solomon's own end.</pre>

<pre>These are also proverbs of Solomon which officials of Hezekiah king of Judah copied: {{rf{2}}} The glory of God conceals things, but the glory of kings searches out things. {{rf{3}}} As heaven is to height and the earth is to depth, so is the heart of kings -- there is no searching. {{rf{4}}} Remove the dross from silver, and it will become a vessel for the smith. {{rf{5}}} Remove the wicked before a king, and his throne will be established in righteousness. {{rf{6}}} Do not promote yourself before the king, and in the place of the great ones do not stand. {{rf{7}}} For it is better that he say to you, &quot;Ascend here,&quot; than he humble you before a noble. What your eyes have seen, {{rf{8}}} do not hastily bring out to court, for what will you do at its end, when your neighbor puts you to shame? {{rf{9}}} Argue your argument with your neighbor himself, the secret of another do not disclose, {{rf{10}}} lest he who hears shame you and your ill repute will not end. {{rf{11}}} Apples of gold in a setting of silver is a matter spoken at its proper time. {{rf{12}}} A ring of gold and an ornament of fine gold is a rebuke of the wise to the ear of a listener. {{rf{13}}} Like the cold of snow on a day of harvest is a faithful messenger to those who send him, and the soul of his master is refreshed. {{rf{14}}} Like clouds and wind when there is no rain, so too is a man who boasts in a gift of deception. {{rf{15}}} With patience a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue will break a bone. {{rf{16}}} If you find honey, eat what is sufficient for you, lest you have your fill of it and vomit it out. {{rf{17}}} Make your foot scarce in the house of your neighbor, lest he become weary of you and hate you. {{rf{18}}} Like a club and sword and a sharp arrow is a man who bears false witness against his neighbor. {{rf{19}}} A bad tooth and a lame foot is the trust of a faithless person in a time of trouble. {{rf{20}}} Like one who removes a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar on natron, is he who sings songs to a heavy heart. {{floatright tiny{ [[Open|Proverbs-25-01]] }}}</pre>

''{{rf{5}}} Better a rebuke that is open than a love that is hidden. {{rf{6}}} The wounds of a friend mean well, but the kisses of an enemy are profane.'' {{rf{7}}} An appetite that is sated spurns honey, but to an appetite that is ravenous, all bitterness is sweet. {{rf{8}}} Like a bird that strays from its nest, so is a man who strays from his place.
